# SiteScribe
Parses the given website and users can then have a chat with their website.

## Brief Description:
SiteScribe does the scraping for website links, loads and splits the content of all the links it can find, embedds it into a vector database, and uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline to answer queries based on website content.


Please Note:
* It's still a work in progress, but core backend logic is done.
* Checkout rag_pipeline.py to try it out yourself
